# FirstRecursion
First recursive project done a while back

This was a simple java project completed in the Fall 2020, learning about basic recusive programming.
I created three classes, each with their own recursive method to accomplish three different tasks.
The first was to calculate the fibonnaci sequence.
The second was a boolean class to check if a sentence/word is a palindrome.
The third reversed a string.

I've programmed more complicated recursive methods in other projects, but most were curropted
a couple months after creation when Eclipse (my coding platform of choice) corrupted and I lost
a lot of my work.
